I"n<p>I currently am a <strong>research consultant</strong> and <strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong> in biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
(<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/">Onnela Lab</a>).
I develop methodologies to study and understand network data, using simulation-based strategies.</p>

<p>In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in biostatistics at the University of Montpellier (<a href="https://imag.edu.umontpellier.fr/">IMAG</a>),
supervised by <a href="https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~marin/">Jean-Michel Marin</a>.
Check out the manuscript: <a href="http://www.theses.fr/2019MONTS035">Bayesian statistical inference for intractable likelihood models</a>!</p>

<p>Apart from strong programming skills, I have built knowledge and experience in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>likehood-free / computational methods</li>
  <li>machine learning algorithms</li>
  <li>Bayesian statistics</li>
  <li>feature selection strategies</li>
  <li>population genetics applications</li>
  <li>network science</li>
</ul>

<p>I am seeking for new exciting opportunities!<br />
I would like to put my skills to good use in an interdisciplinary team, to help with domains such as method development, package conception, data analysis and visualizationâ€¦</p>
