I currently am a **statistician in medical information** at the
[CHD Vend√©e](https://www.chd-vendee.fr/).

In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in biostatistics at the University of Montpellier ([IMAG](https://imag.edu.umontpellier.fr/)),
supervised by [Jean-Michel Marin](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~marin/).
Check out the manuscript: [Bayesian statistical inference for intractable likelihood models](http://www.theses.fr/2019MONTS035)!

Apart from strong programming skills, I have built knowledge and experience in:
* likelihood-free/computational methods;
* machine learning algorithms;
* Bayesian statistics;
* feature selection strategies;
* population genetics applications;
* network science.
